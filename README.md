# Intoduction:
Welcome to my .dotfiles for linux, you may have seen my screenshots on the various discord servers I'm in so I may as well give them to you for anyone to share.
Things will probably be a lot easier if you get GNU stow
For icons, I personally use dark colorful icons, though you can change this in the gtk-4.0/.config/gtk-4.0 config file

# Installation proccess (for arch linux):
- ``sudo pacman -S stow``
- ``git clone https://github.com/Matercan/mater_dotfiles/``
- ``cd mater_dotfiles``
- ``stow <package>``
To get my config for any package


# Requirements:
- xdg-desktop-portal, xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, xdg-desktop-portal-gtk if you want icons for waybar and wofi. my icons are Colorful-Dark icons.
- Just any ssh key manager will work, I have lxqt-openssh-askpass which should generate a file /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-askpass on reboot after installing it.
- Arch linux is my distro, it will probably only work for hyprland.
- Also get the apps of the dotfiles before actually making the dotfiles work?
- If you want shell integration, you should probably work at getting ghostty although I'm sure other places have it too.
- If you want to copy things from neovim to the clipboard, make sure you download xclip (this took me too long to realize, don't fall to the same fate).

Also my hyprland.conf is very similar to the regular hyprland.conf so I wouldn't recommend stowing it because yours is probably better than mine.

Wow very cool I know, anyways, you should probably get GNU stow it will make your life a lot easier to transfer the actual files to your ~/.config.
Also yes, I love celeste who would've guessed.
