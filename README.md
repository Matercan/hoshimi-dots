Welcome to my .dotfiles for linux, you may have seen my screenshots on the various discord servers I'm in so I may as well give them to you for anyone to share.

Requirements:
- xdg-desktop-portal, xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, xdg-desktop-portal-gtk if you want icons for waybar and wofi. my icons are Colorful-Dark icons.
- Arch linux is my distro, it will probably only work for hyprland
- Also get the apps of the dotfiles before actually making the dotfiles work?
- If you want shell integration, you should probably work at getting ghostty although I'm sure other places have it too

Here's some useless screenshots for you to gape and gaw at
