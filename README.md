# 【 Mataercan's hyprland dotfiles 】
A very tame an basic configuration for the window tiling manager hyprland.
Features include:
- A full desktop environment
- Using something me, myself, and I made - not you (make your own dotfiles)
- A really small [configuration](#showcase)
- A really small [install script](#installation)
- No fancy colorscheme generation (yet)

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Matercan/hyprland-dots
cd hyprland-dots
./installation.sh
```
This works no matter the distro, unless you don't have bash :)
WARNING: THIS WILL DELETE YOUR CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF THESE SOFTWARE

To pull back into the hyprland_dots folder, run ``./pull.sh``
